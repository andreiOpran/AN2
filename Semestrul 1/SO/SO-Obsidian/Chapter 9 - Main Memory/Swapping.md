- Process instructions and the data they operate on must be in memory to be executed. 
- However, a process, or a portion of a process, can be <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">swapped</span> temporarily out of memory to a backing store and then brought back into memory for continued execution (<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Figure 9.19</span>).

- Swapping makes it possible for the total physical address space of all processes to exceed the real physical memory of the system, thus increasing the degree of multiprogramming in a system.
