- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Memory protection</span> in a paged environment is accomplished by <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">protection</span> bits associated with each frame. 
	- Normally, these bits are kept in the page table. <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">One bit can define a page to be read-write or read-only</span>. Every reference to memory goes through the page table to find the correct frame number. At the same time that the physical address is being computed, the protection bits can be checked to verify that no writes are being made to a read-only page. An attempt to write to a read-only page causes a<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"> hardware trap</span> to the operating system (<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">or memory-protection violation</span>).
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">One additional bit </span>is generally attached to each entry in the page table: a <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">valid–invalid bit</span>. When this bit is set to valid, the associated page is in the process’s logical address space and is thus a legal (or valid) page. When the bit is set to invalid, the page is not in the process’s logical address space. Illegal addresses are trapped by use of the valid–invalid bit. The operating system sets this bit for each page to allow or disallow access to the page.
- Suppose, for <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">example</span>, that in a system with a 14-bit address space (0 to 16383), we have a program that should use only addresses 0 to 10468. Given a page size of 2 KB, we have the situation shown in <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Figure</span> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">9.</span><span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">13</span>. Addresses in pages 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are mapped normally through the page table. Any attempt to generate an address in pages 6 or 7, however, will find that the valid–invalid bit is set to invalid, and the computer will trap to the operating system (invalid page reference).
