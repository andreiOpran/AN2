- We can prevent a process from accessing memory that it does not own by combining two ideas previously discussed. If we have a system with a relocation register ([[Logical Versus Physical Address Space|Section 9.1.3]]), together with a limit register ([[Basic Hardware|Section 9.1.1]]), we accomplish our goal. 
- The <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">relocation</span> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">register</span> contains the value of the smallest physical address; the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">limit</span> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">register</span> contains the range of logical addresses (for example, relocation = 100040 and limit = 74600). Each logical address must fall within the range specified by the limit register. The MMU maps the logical address dynamically by adding the value in the relocation register. This mapped address is sent to memory (Figure 9.6).

- When the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">CPU scheduler selects a process for execution</span>, the dispatcher loads the relocation and limit registers with the correct values as part of the context switch. Because every address generated by a CPU is checked against these registers, we can protect both the operating system and the other usersâ€™ programs and data from being modified by this running process.
