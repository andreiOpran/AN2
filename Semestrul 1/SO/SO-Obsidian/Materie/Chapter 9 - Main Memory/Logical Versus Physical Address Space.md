- An address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"> logical address</span>, whereas an address seen by the memory unit— that is, the one loaded into the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">memory-address register</span> of the memory—is commonly referred to as a <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">physical address</span>.
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Binding addresses</span> at either <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">compile</span> or <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">load</span> <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">time</span> generates<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"> identical logical and physical addresses</span>. 
	- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">However</span>, the<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"> execution-time</span> address-binding scheme results in <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">differing logical and physical addresses</span>. In this case, we usually refer to the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">logical address</span> as a <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">virtual address</span>. 
	- We use logical address and virtual address interchangeably in this text. 
	- The set of all logical addresses generated by a program is a <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">logical address space</span>. 
	- The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is a <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">physical address space</span>. 
	- Thus, in the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">execution-time address-binding scheme</span>, <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">the logical and physical address spaces differ</span>.
- The run-time <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">mapping</span> from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware device called the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">memory-management unit (MMU)</span> (Figure 9.4).

- We can choose from many different methods to accomplish such <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">mapping</span>, as we discuss in Section 9.2 through Section 9.3.
- The base register is now called a <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">relocation register</span>. The value in the relocation register is added to every address generated by a user process at the time the address is sent to memory (see Figure 9.5).
	- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">For example</span>, if the base is at 14000, then an attempt by the user to address location 0 is dynamically relocated to location 14000; an access to location 346 is mapped to location 14346.

- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">The user program never accesses the real physical addresses</span>. The program can create a pointer to location 346, store it in memory, manipulate it, and compare it with other addresses—all as the number 346. Only when it is used as a memory address (in an indirect load or store, perhaps) is it relocated relative to the base register. <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">The user program deals with logical addresses</span>.
- We now have two different types of addresses: logical addresses (in the range 0 to max) and physical addresses (in the range R + 0 to R + max for a base value R). The user program generates only logical addresses and thinks that the process runs in memory locations from 0 to max. However, these logical addresses must be mapped to physical addresses before they are used. The concept of a logical address space that is bound to a separate physical address space is central to proper memory management.
