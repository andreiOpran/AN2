- CPU scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the processes in the ready queue is to be allocated the CPUâ€™s core.
- Although most modern CPU architectures have multiple processing cores, we describe these scheduling algorithms <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">in the context of only one processing core available</span>. That is, a single CPU that has a single processing core, <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">thus the system is capable of only running one process at a time.</span>
