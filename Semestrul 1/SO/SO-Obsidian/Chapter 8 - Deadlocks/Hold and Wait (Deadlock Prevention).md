- To ensure that the<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)"> hold-and-wait</span> condition never occurs in the system, we must guarantee that, whenever a thread requests a resource, it does not hold any other resources. 
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">One protocol </span>that we can use requires each thread to request and be allocated all its resources before it begins execution. This is, of course, impractical for most applications due to the dynamic nature of requesting resources. 
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">An alternative protocol </span>allows a thread to request resources only when it has none. A thread may request some resources and use them. Before it can request any additional resources, it must release all the resources that it is currently allocated. 
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Both these protocols </span>have two main disadvantages. First, resource utilization may be low, since resources may be allocated but unused for a long period. For example, a thread may be allocated a mutex lock for its entire execution, yet only require it for a short duration. Second, starvation is possible. A thread that needs several popular resources may have to wait indefinitely, because at least one of the resources that it needs is always allocated to some other thread.
