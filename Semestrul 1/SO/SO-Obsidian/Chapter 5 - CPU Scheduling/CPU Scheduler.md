- Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed. The <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">selection process</span> is carried out by the <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">CPU scheduler</span>, which selects a process from the processes in memory that are <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">ready to execute</span> and allocates the CPU to that process.
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Note</span> that the ready queue is not necessarily a first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue. 
	- As we shall see when we consider the various scheduling algorithms, a ready queue can be implemented as a FIFO queue, a priority queue, a tree, or simply an unordered linked list. 
	- Conceptually, however, all the processes in the ready queue are lined up waiting for a chance to run on the CPU. The <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">records</span> in the queues are generally <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">process control blocks (PCBs)</span> of the processes.
